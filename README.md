# SimpleWaves1D - Cross-shore wave transformation

SimpleWaves1D is a simplistic parametric phase-averaged wave model that solves the coupled one-dimensional wave and roller energy flux balance equations.
It implements multiple approaches to parametrize wave energy dissipation by depth induced wave breaking.
The model is provided with the hope that it will be helpful for students or researchers who are new to nearshore wave modelling.
